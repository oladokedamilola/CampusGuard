# 🎯 **CampusGuard AI - Smart Surveillance System**

## 🛡️ **Overview**
**CampusGuard AI** is an intelligent, ICT-driven surveillance and crime detection framework designed specifically for Nigerian educational institutions. The system leverages modern computer vision, AI analytics, and real-time monitoring to enhance security, prevent incidents, and create safer learning environments.

## 🎯 **Core Problem**
Educational institutions across Nigeria face escalating security threats including theft, vandalism, cultism, unauthorized access, and cyber-attacks. Traditional manual security measures are reactive, inefficient, and insufficient against modern security challenges.
